# BAIO: LLM-Based Taxonomy Profiling & Open-Set Pathogen Detection

## Overview

BAIO (Bioinformatics AI for Open-set detection) is a cutting-edge metagenomic analysis platform that leverages foundation models for DNA sequence analysis. Unlike traditional reference-based pipelines (e.g., Kraken2, MetaPhlAn), BAIO can detect novel and divergent pathogens through open-set recognition methods, making it crucial for pandemic preparedness and surveillance.

## Key Features

- **Taxonomy Profiling**: Classifies sequencing reads or contigs into known classes (viral families, bacterial groups, host)
- **Open-Set Detection**: Flags sequences that don't fit known classes as "novel/unknown"
- **Sample-Level Reporting**: Aggregates read-level predictions into intuitive reports for surveillance
- **Interpretability**: Visualizes embeddings, attention patterns, and clusters of novel reads
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: FASTQ ‚Üí Evo2 embeddings ‚Üí classifier + OOD detection ‚Üí GUI report (JSON + PDF)

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Streamlit**: Simple, fast GUI with support for file upload, plots, and dashboards

### Model Runtime
- **PyTorch + Hugging Face Transformers**: Core ML framework
- **Evo2**: Nucleotide model for embeddings
- **Custom Heads**: MLP for taxonomy classification; OOD scores (Max Softmax, Energy, Mahalanobis)

### Bioinformatics Utilities
- **Biopython**: FASTA/FASTQ parsing
- **HDBSCAN**: Clustering novel reads

### Data Processing
- **NumPy/Pandas**: Embedding manipulation
- **Scikit-learn**: Model calibration and evaluation

### DevOps
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline
- **pytest**: Testing framework
- **Conda/Poetry**: Environment management

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for Evo2 model)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/baio.git
cd baio

# Create and activate conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate baio

# Or using Poetry
poetry install
```

## Quick Start

### Running the GUI
```bash
# Using conda
conda activate baio
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py

# Using Poetry
poetry run streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```
## üê≥ Running BAIO with Docker & Docker Compose

You can run the full BAIO stack‚ÄîFastAPI backend and Streamlit UI‚Äîwithout installing Python or dependencies locally.

### 1. Prerequisites
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or Docker Engine with Compose v2.
* Git to clone the repository.

### 2. Environment file
Copy the template and adjust if needed:

### 3. Build and Start the stack
docker compose build
docker compose up

### Basic Usage
1. Upload your FASTQ/FASTA files through the Streamlit interface
2. Configure analysis parameters (sequence length filters, confidence thresholds)
3. Run the analysis pipeline
4. View results including:
   - Taxonomy classifications
   - Novel sequence detection
   - Embedding visualizations
   - Sample-level reports

## Evaluation Metrics

### Closed-Set Taxonomy
- Accuracy, macro-F1
- Per-class Precision/Recall

### Open-Set Detection
- AUROC, AUPR-Out
- FPR@95%TPR

### Sample-Level Analysis
- OSCR matrix
- Confusion across {Known-Correct, Known-Wrong, Unknown-Correct, Unknown-Wrong}

### Performance
- Reads/second processing rate
- Memory footprint

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code
black metaseq/ app/

# Lint code
flake8 metaseq/ app/

# Type checking
mypy metaseq/ app/
```
